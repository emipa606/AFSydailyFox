Update of Amlifurxs mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2134320184

**The release of RimWorld 1.6 added improved support for [Asset Bundles](https://github.com/emipa606/AssetBuilder/blob/main/README.md).**
To avoid doubling the size of the mod, it was re-released using only Asset Bundles, you can find the new version of this mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3540588386).
This version will not receive any further updates.
